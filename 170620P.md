## Concepts learnt

1. Smart Contract - Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met. Within a smart contract, rules regarding how transactions should occur are defined.

2. Distributed Ledger - A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses." The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes.

3. Centralized ledgers is more prone to cyber attacks and fraud as it has a single point of failure. but distributed ledgers are inherently harder to attack because the all the ledger copies distributed all over the world needed to attack simultaniously which can't be possible.
